# Java & Rust Comparison of a Restful Service

This repository showcases two implementations of a restful api service. Its intent is to enable Java practitioners to compare and contrast a web service implemented in both languages. Both servers are reachable and running in production.

## About the tech stacks

### ‚òïÔ∏è Why Java?
Many companies use Java for its ease-of-use and mature libraries.
Java's strongest feature is its object-oriented paradigm that enables developers to model their business logic as a hierarchy of objects.

### ü¶Ä Why Rust?
Rust earned the top spot as the ‚Äúmost-loved‚Äù programming language for the fifth consecutive year of [Stack Overflow‚Äôs developer survey]. The Rust ecosystem has recently seen an explosion in adoption with backing from [major companies]. Rust's most unique feature is the borrow checker, a compilation step that validates references and reclaims inaccessible memory thereby eliminating the need for a runtime garbage collector. This enables Rust programs to be blazingly fast and memory-efficient.
